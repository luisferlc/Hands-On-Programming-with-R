Learning about R Programming.

Here you can find my version of the excercies presented in the book Hands-On-Programming-with-R, that you can find here: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/

There are 3 folders that correspond to each project in the book. Inside of them, are the chapters and the code.
